<p>She'd take the world off my shoulders </p>
<p>If it was ever hard to move </p>
<p>She'd turn the rain to a rainbow </p>
<p>When I was living in the blue </p>
<p>Why then, if she is so perfect </p>
<p>Do I still wish that it was you? </p>
<p>Perfect don't mean that it's working </p>
<p>So what can I do? (Ooh) </p>
<p>When you're out of sight </p>
<p>In my mind </p>
<p>'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes </p>
<p>And that's where I find a glimpse of us </p>
<p>And I try to fall for her touch </p>
<p>But I'm thinking of the way it was </p>
<p>Said I'm fine and said I moved on </p>
<p>I'm only here passing time in her arms </p>
<p>Hoping I'll find </p>
<p>A glimpse of us </p>
<p>Tell me he savors your glory </p>
<p>Does he laugh the way I did? </p>
<p>Is this a part of your story? </p>
<p>One that I had never lived </p>
<p>Maybe one day you'll feel lonely </p>
<p>And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse </p>
<p>Maybe you'll start slipping slowly </p>
<p>And find me again </p>
<p>When you're out of sight </p>
<p>In my mind </p>
<p>'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes </p>
<p>And that's where I find a glimpse of us </p>
<p>And I try to fall for her touch </p>
<p>But I'm thinking of the way it was </p>
<p>Said I'm fine and said I moved on </p>
<p>I'm only here passing time in her arms </p>
<p>Hoping I'll find </p>
<p>A glimpse of us </p>
<p>Ooh, ooh-ooh </p>
<p>Ooh, ooh-ooh </p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh </p>
<p>'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes </p>
<p>And that's where I find a glimpse of us </p>
<p>And I try to fall for her touch </p>
<p>But I'm thinking of the way it was </p>
<p>Said I'm fine and said I moved on </p>
<p>I'm only here passing time in her arms </p>
<p>Hoping I'll find </p>
<p>A glimpse of us </p>
